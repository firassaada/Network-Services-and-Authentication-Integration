        Enabling SSH authentication via OpenLDAP and restricting access.
        Integrating Apache with OpenLDAP for web authentication.
        Implementing OpenVPN with OpenLDAP authentication.

    Management of Network Services with DNS :
        Setting up a separate DNS server (Bind) for service resolution.
        Adding DNS records for OpenLDAP, Apache, and OpenVPN servers.
        Validating DNS resolution for each configured service.

    Authentication with Kerberos :
        Installing and configuring a Kerberos server.
